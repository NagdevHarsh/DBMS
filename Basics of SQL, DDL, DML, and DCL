Basics of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases, enabling users to manage and manipulate data.

Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL is used to define and modify database schema.

CREATE: Creates objects like tables, indexes, and databases.

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

ALTER: Modifies existing database objects.

ALTER TABLE Employees 
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

DROP: Deletes objects from the database.

DROP TABLE Employees;

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML is used for data manipulation within the database.

SELECT: Retrieves data from the database.

Select * from tablename 

INSERT: Adds new data.

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department) 
VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 'HR');


UPDATE: Modifies existing data.

UPDATE Employees 
SET Department = 'Finance' 
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

DELETE: Removes data.

DELETE FROM Employees 
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

Data Control Language (DCL)
DCL manages permissions and access control.

GRANT: Gives users access rights.

GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO 'username';

REVOKE: Removes access rights.

REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM 'username';
