Relational Database Design
Importance of a Good Schema Design
A well-designed schema is essential for the efficiency and scalability of a database. It reduces redundancy, prevents inconsistency, ensures data integrity, and improves query performance.

Problems with Bad Schema Designs
Poor schema design can lead to:

Data redundancy (storing the same data in multiple places)
Data anomalies (insertion, deletion, and update issues)
Complex queries that are harder to maintain and optimize
Normal Forms and Dependency Theory
Normalization is the process of organizing the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Functional dependencies (FDs) are key to this process.

Functional Dependencies (FDs): Describe the relationship between attributes. For example, in a student table, StudentID determines StudentName (if you know the student ID, you can uniquely identify the name).
Armstrong's Axioms: A set of rules used to infer all functional dependencies from a given set.
Closure of FD Set and Attribute Set: The closure of an FD set is the complete set of all FDs that can be inferred from a given set of FDs.
Irreducible Set of FDs: The minimal set of FDs that preserves all original dependencies.
Minimal Covers: The simplest form of FDs, removing any redundant parts of the dependencies.
Normalization Process
Normalization is categorized into different forms (called normal forms) that guide database design to minimize redundancy.

1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that the table has atomic (indivisible) values and no repeating groups.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Builds on 1NF by removing partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend only on part of the primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): Removes transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): A stricter version of 3NF, ensuring that even more complex dependency relationships are removed.
Properties of Relational Decompositions
When decomposing tables to eliminate redundancy:

Lossless Join Decomposition: Ensures that data can be correctly reconstructed after decomposition.
Dependency Preservation: Ensures that all functional dependencies are still enforced after decomposition.
Advanced Normal Forms
4NF (Fourth Normal Form): Eliminates multi-valued dependencies, ensuring that no non-trivial multi-valued dependencies exist.
5NF (Fifth Normal Form): Removes join dependencies, ensuring the database is free from any anomalies that could occur during complex joins.
Example of Functional Dependency:
Suppose we have a table with StudentID, Course, and Instructor. If StudentID -> Course and Course -> Instructor, we have a transitive dependency. This violates 3NF and can be resolved by splitting the table into two: one with StudentID and Course, and another with Course and Instructor.
