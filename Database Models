1. Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)
1.1. Basic Concepts
The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a high-level conceptual data model that describes the structure of a database in terms of entities, relationships, and attributes. It serves as a blueprint for designing a database.

Entities: Objects or things in the real world that can be distinctly identified. Each entity has attributes that describe its properties.
Relationships: Define how entities interact with one another.
Attributes: Properties that describe an entity (e.g., name, age, salary).

1.2. Entities
Entities are the fundamental units in the ER model. An entity represents a thing or object in the real world that has a distinct identity.

Entity Types: A collection of similar entities (e.g., "Student," "Employee").
Entity Sets: A set of all entities of a particular type (e.g., all students).
Attributes: Properties of an entity type. They can be simple (indivisible), composite (made up of sub-parts), single-valued, or multi-valued.
Keys: Attributes that uniquely identify an entity. A primary key is a minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set.
Example:
Entity type: Employee
Attributes: EmployeeID, Name, Designation, Salary

Primary key: EmployeeID
1.3. Relationships
A relationship in an ER model defines an association between two or more entities.

Relationship Types: Categories of relationships (e.g., "works for" between Employee and Department).
Relationship Set: A set of associations between entities.
Roles: The parts that entities play in a relationship.
Structural Constraints: Determine how many entities can participate in a relationship. Common constraints include:
Cardinality: Specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with another entity (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
Participation: Can be total (every entity must participate in a relationship) or partial.

1.4. ER Design Process
Designing an ER model involves the following steps:

Identify entity types.
Identify relationship types.
Define attributes of entities and relationships.
Establish primary keys.
Define constraints (e.g., cardinality, participation).

1.5. ER Diagrams
An ER Diagram is a graphical representation of the ER model. It uses symbols to represent entities (rectangles), relationships (diamonds), and attributes (ovals). Lines connect entities and relationships to show associations.

Weak Entities: Entities that cannot be uniquely identified by their attributes alone and depend on another entity. They are depicted with a double rectangle and have a partial key.

1.6. Extended ER Features
Generalization: The process of combining similar entities into a generalized higher-level entity.
Specialization: The process of dividing a generalized entity into lower-level entities.
Inheritance: Lower-level entities inherit attributes and relationships of the higher-level entities.
Aggregation: Treating a relationship as a higher-level entity and forming relationships with other entities.

1.7. Design of ER Database Schema
An ER database schema defines the structure of the database based on the ER model. This includes:

Entities and their attributes.
Relationships between entities.
Keys and constraints.
Diagrams to visualize the design.

1.8. Reduction of ER Schema to Tables
The process of converting an ER schema into a relational schema involves:

Creating a table for each entity set.
Creating a table for each relationship set.
Including foreign keys to represent relationships.
Handling weak entities by merging them with their owning entities.
